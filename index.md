## About Me

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow and researcher at the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, where I also hold a postdoctoral affiliation with Trinity College. My work sits at the intersection of knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, robotics, and machine learning, with applications spanning intelligent manufacturing, computational biology, and sustainable systems.

I hold a joint Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham, the University of Oxford, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, supported by the European Horizon 2020 programme. Over the past few years, I’ve led and contributed to multi-million-pound research projects, developed AI-driven systems in collaboration with industry leaders like Siemens and ABB, and authored more than 30 research publications, including top-tier journal papers and conference contributions.

Beyond research, I serve as the Chair of the China Chapter of the Marie Curie Alumni Association and actively organize international forums and academic events. I’m passionate about bridging academia and industry, promoting open collaboration, and applying AI to real-world challenges.
## Research Interests
