## About Me/关于我

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow and researcher at the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, where I also hold a postdoctoral affiliation with Trinity College. My work sits at the intersection of knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, robotics, and machine learning, with applications spanning intelligent manufacturing, computational biology, and sustainable systems.
我现为剑桥大学“人工智能研究中心”的玛丽·居里学者，并隶属于剑桥三一学院从事博士后研究工作。我的研究聚焦于知识图谱、图神经网络、机器人技术与机器学习，致力于推动其在智能制造、计算生物学与可持续系统等领域的应用。

I hold a joint Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham, the University of Oxford, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, supported by the European Horizon 2020 programme. Over the past few years, I’ve led and contributed to multi-million-pound research projects, developed AI-driven systems in collaboration with industry leaders like Siemens and ABB, and authored more than 30 research publications, including top-tier journal papers and conference contributions.
我拥有诺丁汉大学、牛津大学与瑞典皇家理工学院联合授予的博士学位，期间获得欧盟地平线2020项目资助。近年来，我主持和参与多个总额达数百万英镑的国际科研项目，与西门子、ABB 等企业联合开发 AI 系统，发表学术论文30余篇，其中多篇发表于国际顶级期刊与会议。

Beyond research, I serve as the Chair of the China Chapter of the Marie Curie Alumni Association and actively organize international forums and academic events. I’m passionate about bridging academia and industry, promoting open collaboration, and applying AI to real-world challenges.
除科研工作外，我还担任“玛丽·居里学者协会中国分会”主席，积极组织国际论坛与学术活动。我热衷于推动产学研融合、促进中欧科研交流，并致力于将人工智能应用于实际问题解决之中。
